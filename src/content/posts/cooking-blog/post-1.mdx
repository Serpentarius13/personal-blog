## Introduction to the kitchen

It's been a long time since I build any personal project and I've decided to build a personal site ~~so the internet would notice me~~
to share some of my findings to help myself and others learn interesting stuff. As [Richard Feynmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) said:

> If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it

I've heard about Astro a lot before and even used it in one of my work projects,
but I have never dived deep enough to figure out why people even need static sites and why not just build everything in React.

Here's the thing: there are a few frameworks on the table right now, such as `Next.js`, `Nuxt`, `Remix`, `SvelteKit`
and others which provide Static Site Generation (SSG), and some of them are cool
at that, but it is not their primary focus. On the other side, `Astro` provides native `Markdown` and `MDX`
parsing and many integrations with `CMS` tools, libraries for quickly adding so-needed `SEO` stuff and bla-bla.

But I think the most important and greatest thing about `Astro` is the architecture it is built upon.
Only `Nuxt` has the same thing from the list: `islands`. Islands are parts of your app that are hydrated to the client,
while the rest of your app stays completely static or on server. Well, `Next.js`'s `React server components` do that too,
but in my opinion, and coming [from this Josh Comeau's article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog-v2/),
`Next.js` is nowhere near developer experience that someone who uses `Vite` (which `Astro` does) under the hood provides.
Also, it is much easier to just slap [`island directive`](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#creating-an-island),
rather than figuring out how to make un-renderable on server UI-library do it.

So, in my eyes, the coolest competitor `Nuxt` it is. `Nuxt` has many great features baked into it, but
it is only `Vue`-based after all. While I love `Vue`, `Astro` gives me
the Thanos' gauntlet to rule them all - I could use any framework in my tooling.
And while it is not a silver bullet for making an app itself - I would rather use `Astro` in 99% cases,
it combines insanely well with **Personal educative blog coolness** while using `MDX` to provide interactive blocks
with `Vue`, `Solid`, `Svelte` and `React` all-packed. Here's an example:

<Counter client:visible />

Sorry for that bunch of `Vue` bundle I got into your browser right now 😆. However, you didn't actually download
it before you have seen it, because I added it like so, with a directive: `<Counter client:visible />`. It works
with `IntersectionObserver` that tracks the element's visibility on the screen, and if it is visible, it will
`hydrate it to the client`. Haven't seen that one anywhere else.

## Mistook apples for oranges

At first I thought it would be the fastest to learn and to use to copy someone else's template and build upon it.
[This one caught my sight](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite) as I was searching through github as it had
everything that I wanted and more. So, I frivoulously cloned it and right away decided to switch UI kit to `Daisy` as
I see `shadcn-ui` as a more SaaS-y approach to styling. That was my horrible mistake and a great blessing,
since I spent an immeasurable amount of time trying to decode someone else's code and decisions while swapping components
one by one. At last, I ended with a half-wit of enscribe's child and my own homunculus:

![Here's the result](./homunculus.png)

I wanted to learn more about `Astro` after finishing rebuilding this template, but at the end I just snapped
and started my own project. I took a lot of inspiration and learning in parts which I didn't understood well from it, so thank you
[the great Open-Sourcer](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite)! 

So, here's my take on `Astro`. You can get all the source snippets from [the repo](https://github.com/Serpentarius13/personal-blog).
Note that sometimes I'm citing partial snippets to show the main ideas, but the full code is always available there.

## Tasty menu

To build a static website, you will come at some issues right away and some will come later.
Here's my full list (aside from the `Astro` itself, that the documentation help you will for):

- How to style it? 🖌️
- Where to get icons? 🎎
- How to make MDX work? 🖊️
- How to highlight code? 🌈
- How to add client-side logic? 🏭
- How to make it searchable? 🔍
- How to store persistent data while being just a single SSG app? 💾
- How to deploy it? 🚀
- How to make it accessible and SEO-compliant? 🤖

So, that would be the contents of this article. Let's begin!

## Instagrammy bacon and eggs

As a styling solution I decided to stick with [`Tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/) as it is the fastest way to write `CSS`.
For the UI-library, as I mentioned, I took [`daisyUI`](https://daisyui.com/) which got me tinker with it for a bit before
actually getting the way to use it, but in the end it was much worth it as I didn't have to write many usable
things from scratch and got an immensely good home-looking design for free, which would take ages to build from scratch.

import ThemeDropdown from "@/components/astro/ThemeDropdown.astro";

One of the most enjoyable things about Daisy is its inbuilt themes support. Take a look at the theme picker right here:

<ThemeDropdown class="!dropdown-top not-prose"> Click me!</ThemeDropdown>

And Daisy has even more themes, although I would hesitate to add them all because the bundle size would grow a little.

This dropdown is built with the use of cool interaction based on `MutationObserver`, which powers I lent for the first time.
While my component renders a dropdown that changes a document `data-theme` property:

```astro
---

<div
  class="dropdown"
>
  <div
    tabindex="0"
    role="button"
  >
    Button
  </div>
  <ul>
    {
        // render all themes from config
      THEMES.map((theme) => {
        return (
            // add data-theme to showcase new colors in a button
          <li data-theme={theme}>
            <div
            // give ids to add event listeners later
              id={`theme-switcher-${theme}`}
            >
              {theme}
            </div>
          </li>
        );
      })
    }
  </ul>
</div>

<script>
  const handleSwitchTheme = (theme: string) => {
    document.documentElement.dataset.theme = theme;
  };

  // add event listeners to switch document theme
  document.querySelectorAll(`[id^="theme-switcher-"]`).forEach((el) => {
    el.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
      event.preventDefault();
      const theme = (event.target as HTMLElement)?.parentElement?.dataset
        .theme as string;
      handleSwitchTheme(theme);
    });
  });
</script>
```

Script loaded in the document watches the changes and reacts with localStorage syncing, while loading the theme from it at first too:

```ts
<script is:inline>
    const darkThemes = ["dark", "aqua"];
    const THEME_KEY = "theme";
    const getThemePreference = () => {
    // if saved return that
    if (typeof localStorage !== "undefined") {
        const theme = localStorage.getItem(THEME_KEY);

        if (theme) {
        return theme;
        }
    }

        // grab user's preferred color scheme if not
    return window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches
        ? // must be synced on its own without config because I don't wanna import themes into head on page load
        "dark"
        : "autumn";
    };

    const getDocumentTheme = () => {
    return document.documentElement.dataset.theme;
    };

    const setDarkMode = (document) => {
    const theme = getThemePreference();

    document.documentElement.dataset.theme = theme;
    };

    setDarkMode(document);

    if (typeof localStorage !== "undefined") {
    // creating observer instance.
    // when `data-theme` defined below changes, it syncs local storage
    const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
        const theme = getDocumentTheme();
        if (!theme) return;
        localStorage.setItem(THEME_KEY, theme);
    });

    observer.observe(document.documentElement, {
        attributes: true,
        attributeFilter: ["data-theme"],
    });
    }
</script>
```

This is way too cool! 😎

One important thing about this approach is that I had to make script `inline` and put it in the `<head>`,
so the website would not ~~FART~~ flicker when loading initially as it would load the script ahead before rendering the page.

As for typography, `daisy` recommends using `@tailwind/typography` package, which I went with. It is nice on itself,
and very tweakable - for example when rendering markdown I wanted to remove this plugin's styles on `<code>` blocks,
and here its done with just one line:

```html
<div class="prose prose-code:not-prose">
```

The last thing I want to mention in this section is `cn` function:

```ts
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

I think you can add it literally in any project with Tailwind,
since it is a live-saver as it does two things:

- It merges all classes with the way resembling `CSS specifity` - last one apply.
- And it removes unnecessary classes when duplicates appear. For example, with `mr-2` and `ml-2` appearing, it would collapse them to just `mx-2`.
- It provides nice API to work with conditional classes instead of ugly `&&`'s:

```ts
<div className={cn("class-1 class-2", {
    "class-3 class-4": isSomeCondition,
})}>
```

Well, anyway, some may find it worse than `&&`'s, but to each their own 🐈

## Combining stolen recipes

While `Astro` provides native `Markdown` language support out of the box via [`Content collections`](ADDLINK),
and gives an easy [`integration`](ADDLINK) to work with `MDX`, this was not all I had to get my eyes at.
While default `MDX` rendering may be sufficient, I had to tweak some parts of it.
I researched on how to do that and stumbled upon [`unified` ecosystem webpage](https://unifiedjs.com/).
`Unified` is a toolset for processing `Markdown`, `HTML`, human-text and other types of content into `AST`'s (Abstract Syntax Trees)
and vice-versa - transforming them back and forth between each other to give you the result you need.

There are two ~~remarkable~~ libraries in this ecosystem I needed: `remark` and `rehype`. `Remark` is a markdown processor,
while `rehype` is an `AST`-to-`HTML` processor. For example, here's the `remark` plugin `recipe` from `Astro` docs, that adds
reading time to article's metadata:

```ts
import type { Root } from "mdast";
import { toString } from "mdast-util-to-string";
import getReadingTime from "reading-time";

export function remarkReadingTime() {
  return function (tree: Root, { data }: any) {
    const textOnPage = toString(tree);
    const readingTime = getReadingTime(textOnPage);
    // readingTime.text will give us minutes read as a friendly string,
    // i.e. "3 min read"
    data.astro.frontmatter.readingTime = readingTime.text;
  };
}
```

It is very simple: it converts a tree to text for a moment and then calculates the reading time from it.

As for `rehype`, I haven't wrote a plugin myself as I didn't need too: [the ecosystem provides them at large](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/).
I used those three guys:
- `rehype-slug` for making heading's slugs to later target them in links via #heading
- `rehype-autolink-headings` to add links to headings, so users would be able to click on them and share with others
- `rehype-sectionize` to add `section` tags wrapping each heading to make it easier to target and style and for better SEO

There's also `rehype-pretty-code` for handling and styling code blocks which I tried to use, but it doesn't support multiple themes with `MDX` yet because
of some unknown bug, so I had to put it down for something else: about this in the next section.


## Exquisite solyanka

```rust title="main.rs"
const explanation: &'static str = r#"
    Solyanka (also spelled sel'yanka) is an old Russian national soup dish.
    The word "solyanka" has a figurative meaning in Russian as
    'mishmash', 'hodgepodge', 'disorder',
    'diverse mixture of the most diverse, hetergenous elements'
"#
```

As a programmer's education resource, I was of course obliged (unlike certain `linkedin` fella) to make working with code blocks
as smooth as possible. That meant syntax highlighting, line numbers, diffing, copy button and so on.

For highlighting code there exist two libraries that I know of: `Prism` and `Shiki`. First of all, `Shiki` is a cool name,
second of all, `Prism` seemed quite outdated and abandoned, and third of all, [this Anthony Fu's article](https://nuxt.com/blog/shiki-v1) convinced me that it was great.
`Shiki`, contrary to `Prism`, works not only at the client, but ahead of the time compiling at the server too,
and it is actually used in `VSCode` as a highlighter, so great support and insane amount of themes are imminent (However, I grabbed only two)

So, how to get `Shiki` working with `MDX` parser? You could write a plugin yourself, but it would be a lot of work of course.
`rehype-pretty-code` plugin I mentioned above is a great one as it provides
almost all the features I needed out of the box, but the problem I mentioned was a big turn-off for me as I wanted to do multiple (2 YEAH!)
themes instead. At the time I was trying to make it work and stumbled upon [`expressive-code`](https://expressive-code.com/).

`expressive-code` is a library that is used under the hood in  [`Astro Starlight` documentation template](ADDLINK).
Out of the box it was way cooler than `rehype-pretty-code` and there was no issues at all. I even wrote my own plugin to blur some lines like that:

```ts blurredLines={1-2}
import {
  secret,
  anotherSecret
} from "@expressive-code/core";

secret(anotherSecret)
```

since it didn't have its own. That just shows how easy it is to make a plugin for it. You can find (the full code for it here)[ADDLINK]

`expressive-code` gave me highlights, line numbers, diffing, copy button and pretty wrappers for blocks instantly for free,
which I liked and went along with it. However, the library may miss some extended features, but it is amendable with plugin API and explanations the docs provide.

## DIY noodles

import HighlightToc from "./HighlightToc.astro";

As for making the app interactive, I went with writing some `addEventListener` in vanilla `JavaScript`, and oh boy, was it not a nice experience.
While being a hacky "frameworker" for two years, I had completely forgotten all the basics of vanilla JS like a spoiled kid,
and it was not easy to even make simple things like adding a class to an element hard. But I was lucky to not write many complex logic outside
of <HighlightToc/>

Table of Contents was one of the hardest parts to make because it took me ages to research on the needed plugins to make
headings and links to render, and also to tweak everything in a `<script>` tag. Some of that was
from unnecessary complexity of my mind which tried to make several different implementations (as in highlight just one
or several headings, what styles to add and so on), and in the end I went the simplest route:

- Highlight every `section` (provided wrapper by `rehype-sectionize`) even remotely on the screen with `IntersectionObserver`
while account for headings margin like so:

```js
    const header = document.querySelector("header");
    const headerHeight = header ? header.offsetHeight : 0;

    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      (sections) => {
        sections.forEach((section) => {
          const heading = section.target.querySelector("h2, h3, h4, h5, h6");
          if (!heading) return;

          const id = heading.getAttribute("id");
          const link = document.querySelector(`#toc li a[href="#${id}"]`);

          if (!link) return;

          link.classList[section.isIntersecting ? "add" : "remove"]("seeing");
        });
      },
      {
        rootMargin: `-${headerHeight}px 0px 0px 0px`,
      })

    const sections = document.querySelectorAll(".prose section");
    sections.forEach((section) => {
      observer.observe(section);
    });
);
```

- Add intercepting smooth scroll to the links:

```js
    const links = document.querySelectorAll(
        "#toc a[href^='#']",
    ) as NodeListOf<HTMLAnchorElement>;

    for (const link of links) {
        link.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const target = document.querySelector(link.href);
        target?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "start" });
        });
    }
```

- On mobile, do not add anything and render the block above the article. Maybe in the future I will add a button
in the header to show it full-screen, but now it is just there.

From that I figured that if you don't know something, you will have a ton of ideas (or none, actually) how to build it,
and may go into a deep rabbit hole of multiple decisions that do not work together. **Plan first, always!** ~~And of course stick to it~~

import HighlightUpButton from "./HighlightUpButton.astro";

For example, for this <HighlightUpButton />, I what to do such things:

- Place it at the bottom right corner of the screen
- Make it appear when scrolling upwards & disappear when scrolling downwards
- Make it scroll smoothly to the top of the screen

Having this plan, after a google search on how to detect scroll direction,
I made this simple script:

```js
import { debounce } from "@/lib/utils";

const attachListeners = () => {

    const button = document.querySelector("#scroll-top-btn");

    button?.addEventListener("click", () => {
        window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: "smooth" });
    });

    let prevScroll = 0;

    const handleScroll = debounce(() => {
        if (!prevScroll) {
            prevScroll = window.scrollY;
            return;
        }

        button?.classList[prevScroll > window.scrollY ? "add" : "remove"](
            "visible",
        );

        prevScroll = window.scrollY;
    }, 100);

    window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
};

document.addEventListener("astro:page-load", attachListeners);
```

Of course, I may not have known about the amount of `scroll` events fired and therefore would not have
used debounce, which would impact my users, but **my code would work**, and I would deal with everything else later.


## Detective's favourite tea

For users to discover my content, I have planned to make two features: 

- A paginated search (which you could find at [here](/blog))
- A global search bar that would be openable from anywhere and would give user ability to search for any content or keyword.

A global search might be done in backend, but when you have few articles that do not have much content,
I don't think the investment in `Algolia` is worth it. 

While `Astro` provides [API for pagination out of the box](ADDLINK), the search is handled by separate libraries.
Coming from `Astro` docs, I found myself before two choices: [`pagefind`](ADDLINK) and [`fuse.js`](ADDLINK).

`pagefind` is a `Rust`-based static search artifacts generator. It makes resources to search at build-time
and an API to call this search from the client. While blazingly-fast sounds cool, at first, I find it difficult
because of the cumbersome way to load `WASM` bundle, artifacts and client-side API that is working through `window` binding.
First, you need to generate it all, then put it in a public folder so you can import js client and so on..

`Fuse.js` is a `JavaScript`-based fuzzy-search library. It has nice API and does its job, but search is very simple.

So, I have decided on Fuse because of its simplicity. Here's how it went:

- Firstly, I wanted to see what happens when I use it over 100 fat articles on the client. It was horrible as initial
HTML Astro sent was about `26 megabytes!`. So, I had another idea.
- I have read recently from Astro docs, that they have added something like "Server actions" with `rpc`-like client.
It was very pleasant to work with as you can import actions all around the project and even in UI libs and scripts,
while having good API that was much better than `fetch` to work with, because actions provided in-built `zod` validation
with type inference and public API.
- So, I have set up something like that:

```ts
export const prerender = false;

export interface SearchRecordResult
  extends Pick<
    SearchRecord,
    "title" | "image" | "description" | "tags" | "slug"
  > {}

// get all records
const collection = await getCollection("posts");

// transform them to searchable records
const records = collection.map((c) => {
  return {
    title: c.data.title,
    content: c.body,
    description: c.data.description,
    tags: c.data.tags || [],
    slug: c.slug,
    image: c.data.image.src,
  };
}) satisfies SearchRecord[];

// initialize Fuse
const fuse = new Fuse(records, {
  keys: ["title", "content", "description", "tags"],
  threshold: 0.45,
  ignoreLocation: true,
  isCaseSensitive: false,
});

export const server = {
  // define action
  searchArticles: defineAction({
    input: z.object({
      // with one search field
      search: z
        .string()
        .max(200, "Search term must be less than 200 characters"),
    }),
    // handle search if no field was provided or when it was
    handler: async ({ search }): Promise<SearchRecordResult[]> => {
      if (!search) return records.map(({ content, ...record }) => record);

      return fuse
        .search(search, { limit: 30 })
        .map(({ item: { content, ...item } }) => item);
    },
  }),
}
```

- And I was rendering it on the client with `Solid.js` and it's cool `createResource` hook.

But, while I was writing this article, I reconsidered the idea of pagefind being insurmountable.
It has a feature that provides exact text excerpts, while with Fuse I was limited to just showing simple cards,
and also filtering, sorting and so on. I wanted to find out if it was possible to build with it the way it would work. And it did.

Thanks to [this library](https://github.com/shishkin/astro-pagefind), it was possible to integrate pagefind with Astro in few clicks.
However, I still had to rewrite all my logic for it to work. So, I decided on a plan:

- I would trade `Solid` to `preact` as a renderer, which would reduce bundle size a bit while removing the whole search modal component.
- I would remove actions alltogether, because they load client-side JavaScript that was certainly unnecessary just to make an HTTP-request.
- I would use `pagefind` solely with Astro. That meant I would have to place daisy's `<dialog>` component in the `<body>`.

I made two components: `<SearchTrigger>` and `<SearchDialog>`. The first one is a button that opens the search modal,
which I put in the navbar, while the second one is a modal that is opened with `dialog` element.

I had some tinkering, mostly struggling with building & assets loading. For the lib to work, you need to build your project first,
and then it would load pagefind script with Vite. Assets loading really crushed me though. At first, I placed `dialog` in the body,
but in the wrong place: right below my navbar. It was a critical mistake, as its loading prevented whole page to load, so I moved it lower.
Also, as a novice bundle optimizer, I was worried that my dev client bundle grew to 1.7mb, however in production it still stays about 200kb.

In the end, I had a great experience with fuzzy-finding. It was quite easy to adapt the lib to work with all daisy themes
and make it adaptive. So, cheers to pagefind! Choose your libs wisely 👼

## A go to the cellar

When I was looking for inspiration, I stumbled again upon [Josh Comeau's website](ADDLINK). It had this cool heart button
that I wanted to steal. 

## Rocket cake

vercel, adapters, local adapter

## Gordon Ramsay's show
 
seo, robots, performance, sitemap, meta tags, lighthouse

## Finale

astro is cool, do not over-engineer, get the basics out, give out
