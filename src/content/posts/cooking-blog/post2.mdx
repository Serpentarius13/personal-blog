## Introduction to the kitchen

I have not built a personal project for a long time. When I set out to be a developer, I was full of ideas, and I was trying them out. After so long, I have probably burned myself out with unfulfilled dreams of making this one perfect thought in my head come true. Perhaps, painters have the same horror in their lives that they're out to overcome. 

This project wasn't an exception. I'm quite highly neurotic and perfectionistic, and while some could scribble their thoughts onto a piece of HTML paragraphs that would be easily readable everywhere, so they would make a huge impact, I wanted to make something pretty and technological, to try out the new stuff.

Every time I have done or was doing something, I would have a new idea,
that would drop into my Obsidian Kanban board to later be picked up by me, and the cycle would repeat. Feature after feature, I was thinking of the perfect image to build this website into,
and failed. So, here's my final take at it with this revised article, which covers some nice solutions to building a blog, a tale about perfectionism and some cuteness along the way.

I have tried out Astro at work before, but never really dived deep into understanding how all those
modern popular frameworks differ and why they are even needed: `Next.js`, `Nuxt`, `Remix`, `SvelteKit` and so on. My understanding was purely theoretical and very simple: if you want to build something for SEO, grab SSR, if not, client-side is enough. To a junior growing into more complex and wise approach to tech, all the noise of trying new things in YouTube tutorials was unbearable to shut down. 

As time gone by, I have learned and tried things out a bit and have become less trendy. Building this website gave me a perspective into matters of rendering modes, load times, JavaScript bundle sizes, using a new ecosystem and learning through the docs and pure interest. And here's what I learned!

## A long recipe explanation

How Astro is different from anything? Why not build a website in pure React or even HTML and CSS? Why not use any other meta-framework that provides Static Site Generation (SSG)? 

Astro is a SSG framework at its base, and could be taken as such: you could use any modern UI library like React or Vue to build your static HTML pages without any JavaScript leaking to the frontend.
