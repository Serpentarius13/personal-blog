feedback and criticism on your blog, but they're

I've been feeling blind when writing on my own website after things like Medium because I haven't added a comments functionality. They are quite useful when blogging, you can have feedback, better or worse, points on which to improve, and just see that your blog is alive.

However, working with comments is certainly not an easy task - you must design and code a complete full-blown feature, including reactions, replies, and most importantly moderation. I could've added a simple textarea with a button and some challenge to comment, but it is easily crackable in the age of AI.

I've already seen a well-designed comment functionality in [Tk Todo's blog](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/all), and I remembered that it was something GitHub-powered. I did a fast google search and found out about [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), which is a very simple to implement `<script>` tag that works based on your public GitHub repo.

It works by utilizing issues (which is creates automatically, if needed) on which the users can chat, reply to each other, react with emoji, add code block and report someone malicious if they'd like. It also gates commenting behind `GitHub OAuth`, which should eliminate spam completely. It even features multiple themes, two of which I've employed on my blog.

To set it up, we can pass through a simple form on their website, or just configure everything ourselves. There's no huge documentation, so the builder was helpful for me to get started easily. I've chosen `issue-term` (determinator of issue to be linked with a script block to comment in) to be title of my blog's page (which I will probably change later as it is not really a constant variable), although there's a vast majority of options, including even `og:meta` parsing.

You can also create issues manually and link them by either issue number or a word in the title. It is sad that it's not possible to link issues by tags, but that's quite a rough functionality to implement, because you can add multiple of the same tags on many issues. Here's my final script from the builder:

```html
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="[ENTER REPO HERE]"
        issue-term="title"
        label="blog"
        theme="github-light"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```

As my blog is a "template" for others to fork too (although not a big one!), I've added a global `UTTERANCES_CONFIG`, which you can omit and use the object straight up later. Here, I've chosen a label `blog` to mark all auto-created issues with it, and, as mentioned previously, `issue-term` is `title`. `repo` is in `owner/repoName` format, which I've also included directly without the use of environment variables, but you can do whatever.

```ts
export const UTTERANCES_CONFIG = {
  repo: "Serpentarius13/personal-blog",
  label: "blog",
  ["issue-term"]: "title",
};
```

The functionality I needed was pretty dynamic, so I have decided to not add a static script element to HTML somewhere in my Astro blog page. Instead I've created an `UtterancesScript.astro` file, which is a simple Astro component, to incapsulate the whole logic in there.

It first appends HTML markup stored in `loader` variable to render a little loader before comments appear, and then prepares a `script` element to be attached to `utterances-container`. I'm attaching listener with `addEventListener` (which I hadn't even know you could use like that!) to check for an event that `utterances` sends when it loads and I set the `isLoaded` flag to `true`. A `MutationObserver` later syncs the theme based on the theme set on website's `documentElement` now, next theme is retrieved with `getNextTheme` function, and `swapTheme` sends a message to `utterances`'s `client.js` script.

Here's a full version this component.

```html
---
import { UTTERANCES_CONFIG } from "config";
---

<script is:inline define:vars={{ UTTERANCES_CONFIG }}>
// mark script as is:inline to not be processed by Astro
// pass UTTERANCES_CONFIG with define:vars
// you can specify options right inside this script if you
// don't want to move them out

// my darkThemes map object to check whether current theme's dark
  const darkThemes = {
    night: "night",
    luxury: "luxury",
  };

// loader markup
const loader = `
  <div class="flex p-2 rounded-xl border border-primary items-center gap-2 mx-auto w-fit mt-4" id="utterances-spinner">
    <span class="loading loading-infinity loading-xl">
    </span>
    <span class="text-xl">
      Loading comments...
    </span>
  </div>`;

// utterances url for reuse
  const UTTERANCES_URL = "https://utteranc.es";

  let isLoaded = false;
// gets next comments theme based on current website theme
  const getNextTheme = () => {
    const theme = document.documentElement.dataset.theme || "";
    return theme in darkThemes ? "gruvbox-dark" : "boxy-light";
  };

// loader function to reuse twice
  const load = () => {
    // I've added a div with id of utterances-container right
    // below my post's content. You can put it anywhere
    const container = document.getElementById("utterances-container");
    const loaderWrapper = document.getElementById("utterances-loader");
    // check everything is loaded
    if (!container) {
      console.log("no utterances container found");
      return;
    }
    if (!loaderWrapper) {
      console.log("no utterances loaderWrapper found");
      return;
    }
    
    // toggle loader
    loaderWrapper.innerHTML = loader;

    // extract theme
    const theme = document.documentElement.dataset.theme || "";

    // create script and map over attributes.
    // it is important to use "setAttribute" instead
    // of assigning because assigning won't work
    // on html elements
    const script = document.createElement("script");

    const attributes = {
      theme: getNextTheme(),
      ...UTTERANCES_CONFIG,
    };

    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(attributes)) {
      script.setAttribute(key, value);
    }

	  // passing constant parameters
    script.src = `${UTTERANCES_URL}/client.js`;
    script.crossOrigin = "anonymous";
    script.async = true;

	  script.onerror = (e) => console.log("error loading utterances:", e);

    // check for load
    addEventListener("message", (event) => {
      if (event.origin !== UTTERANCES_URL) return;
      isLoaded = true;
      loaderWrapper.innerHTML = "";
    });

	  // append a script to container to be ran
    container.append(script);
  };

  // we retrieve iframe's contentWindow
  // to postMessage there a "set-theme" event
	const swapTheme = () => {
    const message = {
      type: "set-theme",
      theme: getNextTheme(),
    };
    const utterances = document
      .getElementById("utterances-container")
      ?.querySelector("iframe")?.contentWindow;
    utterances?.postMessage(message, UTTERANCES_URL);
  };

  const observer = new MutationObserver((records) => {
    if (!isLoaded) return;

    for (const record of records) {
      if (record.attributeName !== "data-theme") return;

      swapTheme();
    }
  });

  observer.observe(document.documentElement, {
    attributes: true,
    attributeFilter: ["data-theme"],
  });

  // load once on running the script
  load();
</script>

```

Here's a simplified version for you to copy and paste:

```html
---

---

<script is:inline>
  const darkThemes = {
    night: "night",
    luxury: "luxury",
  };
  const UTTERANCES_URL = "https://utteranc.es";

  let isLoaded = false;
  const getNextTheme = () => {
    const theme = document.documentElement.dataset.theme || "";
    return theme in darkThemes ? "gruvbox-dark" : "boxy-light";
  };

  const load = () => {
    const container = document.getElementById("utterances-container");
    const loaderWrapper = document.getElementById("utterances-loader");
    if (!container) {
      console.log("no utterances container found");
      return;
    }
    if (!loaderWrapper) {
      console.log("no utterances loaderWrapper found");
      return;
    }

    loaderWrapper.innerHTML = loader;

    const script = document.createElement("script");

    const attributes = {
      theme: getNextTheme(),
      ...UTTERANCES_CONFIG,
    };

    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(attributes)) {
      script.setAttribute(key, value);
    }

    script.src = `${UTTERANCES_URL}/client.js`;
    script.crossOrigin = "anonymous";
    script.async = true;

    script.onerror = (e) => console.log("error loading utterances:", e);

    addEventListener("message", (event) => {
      if (event.origin !== UTTERANCES_URL) return;
      isLoaded = true;
      loaderWrapper.innerHTML = "";
    });

    container.append(script);
  };

  const swapTheme = () => {
    const message = {
      type: "set-theme",
      theme: getNextTheme(),
    };
    const utterances = document
      .getElementById("utterances-container")
      ?.querySelector("iframe")?.contentWindow;
    utterances?.postMessage(message, UTTERANCES_URL);
  };

  const observer = new MutationObserver((records) => {
    if (!isLoaded) return;

    for (const record of records) {
      if (record.attributeName !== "data-theme") return;

      swapTheme();
    }
  });

  observer.observe(document.documentElement, {
    attributes: true,
    attributeFilter: ["data-theme"],
  });

  load();
</script>
```

Markup below the post looks like this:

```html
<div>
    <div id="utterances-loader"></div>
    <div id="utterances-container"></div>
</div>
```

As `utterances` creates issues with a template that I didn't like (a title with a url to follow in contents - yes I wanted a link with a name), I've also decided to create issues for my four blog posts myself in this manner:

import githubIssue from './github-issue.png';

<MdxImage src={githubIssue} alt="A GitHub issue with post name as title and 'Post' hyperlink leading to the post's page"/>

If you have a lot of articles, you can use `GitHub API` to do this automatically on a large dataset retrieved from your database or `Content Collections`. You can run it every time your application deploys to ensure that every article has its issue to comment.

That's all! Thanks for reading!
