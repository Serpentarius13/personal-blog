# Project Title: Dynamic Heading Selector

## Introduction

In modern web development, selecting elements based on their attributes is a common task. This project demonstrates how to dynamically select headings with specific `id` attributes using pure JavaScript. The focus is on headings that start with a specific string, allowing for flexible and efficient DOM manipulation.

## Project Overview

This project provides a simple way to select headings in an HTML document based on their `id` attributes. By using the `querySelectorAll` method, we can efficiently find all headings that match a specific pattern.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-heading-selector.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

### Selecting Headings

To select headings with `id` attributes that start with "bh-", you can use the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const headings = document.querySelectorAll('[id^="bh-"]');
  console.log(headings); // Logs the NodeList of headings
});
```

### Example Code

Here is a complete example of an HTML document that utilizes the dynamic heading selector:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Dynamic Heading Selector</title>
    <style>
      h1,
      h2,
      h3 {
        color: #333;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="bh-1">Heading 1</h1>
    <h2 id="bh-2">Heading 2</h2>
    <h3 id="bh-3">Heading 3</h3>
    <h2 id="other-1">Other Heading</h2>

    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
        const headings = document.querySelectorAll('[id^="bh-"]');
        headings.forEach((heading) => {
          heading.style.color = "blue"; // Change color of selected headings
        });
        console.log(headings); // Logs the NodeList of headings
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

This project illustrates how to dynamically select and manipulate headings in an HTML document using pure JavaScript. By leveraging the `querySelectorAll` method with attribute selectors, developers can efficiently target elements based on their `id` attributes.
